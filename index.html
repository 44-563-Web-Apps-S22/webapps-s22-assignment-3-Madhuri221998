<h3> My favorite place to buy food is Paradise biryani</h3>
<p>The <b>Paradise</b> brand has its origins in a small Canteen and a Café in <br>a cinema theatre called Paradise in Secunderabad in the Year 1953.
     A small <em>100-seater</em> restaurant started serving typical <b>Hyderabadi cuisine</b> like Biryani etc. <br>from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food items to the people as a one-stop Food Store.</p>

<h2>Directions to Travel</h2>
<p> Rajiv Gandhi International Airport is the nearest Airport to Paradise Biryani.
 It is located in the heart of Hyderabad India 
    It would talk approx. 50minutes to reach this location from the Airport.

<h1>Sparse Table</h1>
<blockquote>Sparse Table is a data structure, that allows answering range queries. It can answer most range queries in , but its true power is answering range minimum queries (or equivalent range maximum queries). For those queries it can compute the answer in  time.

    The only drawback of this data structure is, that it can only be used on immutable arrays. This means, that the array cannot be changed between two queries. If any element in the array changes, the complete data structure has to be recomputed.</blockquote>
