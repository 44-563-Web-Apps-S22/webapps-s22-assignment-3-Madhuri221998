<h3> My favorite place to buy food is Paradise biryani</h3>
<h4> This biryani is cooked by dum style where the chicken and rice are let to cook <br>
    together by placing an airtight lid to the vessel. This is one of the easiest recipe ever. <br>
    Instead of using fried onions, I microwaved the onions for 20-30 minutes until they caramelized.<br>
    This saves a lot of calories and oil.</h4>
