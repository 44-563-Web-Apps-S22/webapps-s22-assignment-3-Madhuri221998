<h3> My favorite place to buy food is Paradise biryani</h3>
<p>The <b>Paradise</b> brand has its origins in a small Canteen and a Café in <br>a cinema theatre called Paradise in Secunderabad in the Year 1953.
     A small <em>100-seater</em> restaurant started serving typical <b>Hyderabadi cuisine</b> like Biryani etc. <br>from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food items to the people as a one-stop Food Store.</p>

<h2>Directions to Travel</h2>
<p> Rajiv Gandhi International Airport is the nearest Airport to Paradise Biryani.
 It is located in the heart of Hyderabad India 
    It would talk approx. 50minutes to reach this location from the Airport.
