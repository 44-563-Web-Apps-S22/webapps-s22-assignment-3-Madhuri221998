<h3> My favorite place to buy food is Paradise biryani</h3>
<h4> The <b>Paradise</b> brand has its origins in a small Canteen and a Café in <br>a cinema theatre called Paradise in Secunderabad in the Year 1953.
     A small <em>100-seater</em> restaurant started serving typical <b>Hyderabadi cuisine</b> like Biryani etc. <br>from early Sixties. The Café also used to sell general food items to the people as a one-stop Food Store.</h4>
